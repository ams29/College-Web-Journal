…it has great practical value – you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you – daft as a bush, but very, very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

The Little Ones
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
They burrow between the cracks in our reality, craving the taste of clouds, feeling only the coarse, rough dirt below. Peering eyes examine but do not see, too small to notice. Living beneath us, they hear our speech, see our actions, smell our food. Our footsteps rattle their homes and shake their souls, they tremble in fear.
Their brains are small, perception of time flows by. See our trees fall, our towers rise, our people perish in the blink of an eye. They shake their heads in shame.
“If only they were small like us, they would see it all.”

As for projects, it’s hard to say since the number of projects for this course seem to be changing all the time. For example, last semester there was an additional optional project that wasn’t offered in the semesters before that. But the deadlines are pretty consistent, it’s usually 2 weeks after the project is assigned.
You can’t find information about the exam questions because as per mostly all CS classes, the test papers are collected at the end of the exam. All readings and lecture outlines can be found here https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deppeler/cs400/
Word of advice, if you’re taking this class alone, try to get to know as many people as you can earlier on. Since the final project is a group project, this will make it much easier to find a group later on.
I’d say don’t worry too much. If you did well in CS300, I guarantee CS400 will be a breeze since most people would agree it’s easier

A Farewell To Arms

In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.

Echoes

“Dispatch, I’m ten-twenty at Valley Juvenile Detention building. Exterior is clear, and proceeding inside. Ten-four”.
The former minimum security facility, abandoned for decades, was soon scheduled to be bulldozed for a shopping mall. A passer-by had reported movement inside. As new man on the roster, it was my duty to check for unauthorized “visitors” tonight, likely nocturnal copper thieves stealing wire and plumbing. It was almost midnight and I apprehensively swung the entrance door aside and stepped into the gloom.
From the dormitory cells, I heard faint shuffling sounds and swept my Maglite, but there was no one and no sign of activity. Then, I heard a low crying from an area I had already cleared. It was a boy of about ten, curled up in a ball, hugging his knees.
“Is there anyone here with you?” He shook his head no. “Come with me, son.”
I got him into the back seat of my cruiser.
“Dispatch, it was just a kid. I’m bringing him in, ten-four.”
“Uh-huh. We’ll see. Ten-four.”
At the station, I opened the rear door and froze. The car was empty and the boy was gone.

Notes From Underground
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
I am a sick man. ... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I understand it, though. Of course, I can't explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot "pay out" the doctors by not consulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and no one else. But still, if I don't consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad, well then let it hurt even worse!

Hide and Seek…
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
“Found!” Bryce yelled.
“Time to go!” their father hollered. “No more of your games. The tour starts in thirty.” The trio headed to the penitentiary. “I must be some big shot to get us on the first tour ever.”
The boys marveled at the old, now closed, jail. All the places they could hide. All the hours they could play.
The tour guide prattled on about the jail’s history, its famous inmates and one inmate never found. Convicted murderer Oliver Seaver. “Escaped, dead, or still here? We do not know.”
Reign and Bryce trailed behind, bored.
The guide continued, “Some say they still see him wandering the halls.” He cackled, scaring no one. “Is it his ghost? Or is he still here?”
“Hide and seek?” Bryce whispered.
Reign nodded and started to count. “Ten…nine…”
Bryce hid under a bed and waited. He heard Reign’s calls. And he remained hidden.
He heard his father’s calls. And he remained hidden.
Bryce heard the jingle of keys and the cell door closed. The lights shut off.
The museum closed for the night.
Leaving Bryce still hidden under the bed.
And then he was found.
But not by his brother.

Exchange
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
In 1969, I became an exchange student. I left home to spend the summer with my girlfriend’s family. They lived on a cliff, in a stucco house, overlooking Lake Ontario. The box radio sitting on top of the fridge played British Invasion, day in, day out. My girl used to test my language skills by pointing at the radio’s name-brand. Say this, she’d say, and I’d look at the script and spit out: Moe-Toe-Role-Ah. She’d laugh at my accent, which made me feel tiny, even though I’m terribly tall. I just needed more practice, that’s all—just like French kissing.

It's been a few years since I took 577 with Dieter, but for me, what helped the most was the homework and practice problems. The textbook (if it's still being used) is incredibly dry, and I only really used it as a reference. If you are having trouble with the homework problems, try to boil them down to only essential pieces of information, and put it down on a piece of paper.
Problems are often just variations of each other with unnecessary details layered on the top. If you can strip away the unnecessary details, it becomes easier to recognize patterns and reach a solution. For example, greedy algorithm problems will often ask you find the max / min solution given a large set of inputs that can be solved with brute force, simple math. When you come across something like that, you have a few ways of optimizing the brute force solution for a greedy solution.

THE MONSTER INSIDE
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
Rusting iron smells like blood; it sickens me. This foul odor permeates my senses and defines my barren existence, overpowering all else. But do not pity me in my cage, I chose this life. No, I am not a monk; they abandoned the monastery years before the gates went in. These wretched bunks were theirs. The brotherhood eschewed comfort to better concentrate on prayer–as if prayer could save them. One by one, fear drove them out, down the mountain, away from the village, beyond the reach of the monster that killed indiscriminately, for his own pleasure. Some said he was the devil sent from hell to torment them. Others said he was a man, tortured by demons that forced him to do unspeakable things. But is that not the case with all murderous villains? Bloodlust is madness, a blind frenzy that feeds on fear, thrives on terror; it cannot be resisted. I would know…
I, too, feared the monster. He terrified me more because I knew him so intimately. But I was the only one who could stop him, end the killing. Thus, I did what had to be done. I locked him in this cage.

So I got an AB in the class. How? Well lots of things! The most valuable thing I did was do the homework every week with a study group. Chances were high that at least one of us could pull together an answer, which automatically meant a perfect homework grade. On top of that, it was a great way to review material and learn how to apply it. You could get immediate feedback from other students on your ideas, and if you don’t get something, someone else can explain it to you. So GET A STUDY GROUP!
With that, go to lecture. Take lots of notes. Review, review, review. Do the practice problems. I like making small review sheets which can help you reference concepts you may have forgotten. It helps keep big ideas in the front of your mind.
Ultimately, this course is about giving you a toolset and teaching you how to use each tool. That mindset helped me mentally organize what I learned and how to apply it.

It didn’t seem right, but we set the clocks and got the children up at midnight to go out and yell at the squash. A time-tested deterrent, it didn’t harm the vegetables, but the negative voice lodged in the prickly vine, alarming the squirrels like the sentry crows, who swooped down in a rage to chase them away. When we ran out of children we tried pre-recorded messages, but the squirrels severed the connection and dragged off the squash. Now, we summon our inner children, and the squash grows large. But we have to be quiet because of the neighbors.

The Choice
afeiwoh6879DWIOIh
Montresor fumed at the delay. What was taking so long? And he gagged at the odor— despite covering his mouth with his kerchief. Was it the foul-breathed vintner unlocking the heavy iron door? Or the stench of the nitre lining the brick archways and plastered walls of the cellar?
No matter, but each passing second impeded completion of his business and delayed his return to the fresh light of day, where a carnival of joy and reckoning awaited. The plan was in motion. He must continue.
At last. He moved rapidly past the prison-like bars toward sturdy wooden racks laden with barrel after barrel of sherry.
“Which shall you choose, Signore?” The vintner adjusted his lantern, illuminating oaken casks as far as the light would carry. “A mature Fino—still protected by the flor—or  an Oloroso, perhaps?”
“Neither. Something more refined. I have a colleague—a true connoisseur—who will embark this night on a long sojourn. I wish to give him a memorable farewell.”
“Amontillado, then?”
“Yes, of course.” He nodded. “A full pipe of Amontillado. Only the best will suffice. Send it forthwith to my palazzo. Your silver awaits.”
Montresor smiled in anticipation.

I just attended the first lecture for OS and I’m honestly kinda freaked out. The professor mentioned at least a minimum of five times about how hard the course will be. About the projects, is it possible to do it all solo or will I be forced to do in with a partner/group ? I prefer working on course projects by myself by far
1. Yup, pretty hard course. Anticipate putting in a lot of effort. 15-30 hours per project with significant reading time and studying for exams.
2. there's probably 100 people on the wait list so if they can weed out uncommitted people looking for an easy course that would be nice for them and other students.

Well past her due date and feeling unrelenting pressure, Mary visited the restroom for the fifth time, while Jack recalculated the tip. As he slid from the booth, the waitress leaned in, a cigarette resting in the V of two fingers.
“Light?”
She was a slim, red-haired woman with lacquered fingernails.
She held the cigarette an inch from her glossy mouth.
Jack didn’t smoke, but he patted his pockets anyway.
“Sorry,” he grimaced.
“Don’t be!”
She pressed a book of matches into Jack’s palm.
“My number’s inside,” she whispered.
One year later, Jack used those matches to light birthday candles.
